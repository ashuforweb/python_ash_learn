'''This python file have all the built-in functions of python and their examples.
This file is to be used for reference and explain the functions in more detail view.'''


'''The first built-in function is abs(x): Return the absolute value of a number.
 The single argument may be a plain or long integer or a floating point number.
 If the argument is a complex number, its magnitude is returned.'''
# To explain and examplified this let's initiate x as some number
x = 1
print abs(x) #This will print 1
x = 1.5
print abs(x) #This will print 1.5
x = 1.7267467272723723823
print abs(x) #This will print 1.7267467272723723823
x = complex(1+3j) #This will print magnitude of 1=3j which is calculated as âˆš(1^2+3^2)
print abs(x)

'''This is about all(iterable) function. The single argument is to be iterable and
the output is True if all the elements of iterables are true or iterable is empty else False.'''
theList = []
print all(theList) # This will print True as the iterable list 'theList' is empty
theList = [True,True,True,True,True,True,True,]
print all(theList) # This will print True as all the elements of this list are True.
theList = [True,True,True,False]
print all(theList) # This will print False as not all the elements (last element is False) are not true.

'''This is about any(iterable) function. The single argument is to be iterable and
the output is True if any of the elements of iterables are True else False.'''
theList = [False,False,True,False,False]
print any(theList) # This will print True as 3rd element of the list is true.
theList = []
print any(theList) # This will print False as it's emplty list.
theList = [False,False,False,False]
print any(theList) # This will print False as all elements are False.
